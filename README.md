===================

MarqueeView which supports custom timings.

It can be used to fine-tune the animation speed and the pause between each movement.

Simply add a single TextView within the MarqueeView instance.

The view can be configured via Java code, or through XML. Please see the sample for details.

Including In Your Project
-------------------------

If you are a Maven user you can easily include the library by specifying it as
a dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>asia.ivity.android</groupId>
      <artifactId>marqueeview-apklib</artifactId>
      <version>{insert-latest-version}</version>
      <type>apklib</type>
    </dependency>

If you are using gradle, you can refer to the .aar version like so:

    // Ensure to fetch dependencies from maven central
    repositories {
      mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
      compile 'asia.ivity.android:marqueeview:{insert-latest-version}@aar'
    }
